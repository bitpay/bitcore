A Multisig HD Bitcore Wallet Service.

# Description

Bitcore Wallet Service facilitates multisig HD wallets creation and operation through a (hopefully) simple and intuitive REST API.

BWS can usually be installed within minutes and accommodates all the needed infrastructure for peers in a multisig wallet to communicate and operate â€“ with minimum server trust.
  
See [Bitcore-wallet-client](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-client) for the *official* client library that communicates to BWS and verifies its response. Also check [Bitcore-wallet](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet) for a simple CLI wallet implementation that relies on BWS.

BWS is been used in production enviroments for [Copay Wallet](https://copay.io), [Bitpay App wallet](https://bitpay.com/wallet) and others.  

More about BWS at https://blog.bitpay.com/announcing-the-bitcore-wallet-suite/

# Getting Started
```
 git clone https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service.git
 cd bitcore-wallet-service
 npm install
 npm start
```


This will launch the BWS service (with default settings) at `http://localhost:3232/bws/api`.

BWS needs mongoDB. You can configure the connection at `config.js`

BWS supports SSL and Clustering. For a detailed guide on installing BWS with extra features see [Installing BWS](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service/blob/master/installation.md). 

BWS uses by default a Request Rate Limitation to CreateWallet endpoint. If you need to modify it, check defaults.js' `Defaults.RateLimit`

# Using BWS with PM2

BWS can be used with PM2 with the provided `app.js` script: 
 
```
  pm2 start app.js --name "bitcoin-wallet-service"
```

# Security Considerations
 * Private keys are never sent to BWS. Copayers store them locally.
 * Extended public keys are stored on BWS. This allows BWS to easily check wallet balance, send offline notifications to copayers, etc.
 * During wallet creation, the initial copayer creates a wallet secret that contains a private key. All copayers need to prove they have the secret by signing their information with this private key when joining the wallet. The secret should be shared using secured channels.
 * A copayer could join the wallet more than once, and there is no mechanism to prevent this. See [wallet](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet)'s confirm command, for a method for confirming copayers.
 * All BWS responses are verified:
  * Addresses and change addresses are derived independently and locally by the copayers from their local data.
  * TX Proposals templates are signed by copayers and verified by others, so the BWS cannot create or tamper with them.

# Using SSL

  You can add your certificates at the config.js using:

``` json
   https: true,
   privateKeyFile: 'private.pem',
   certificateFile: 'cert.pem',
  ////// The following is only for certs which are not
  ////// trusted by nodejs 'https' by default
  ////// CAs like Verisign do not require this
  // CAinter1: '', // ex. 'COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt'
  // CAinter2: '', // ex. 'COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt'
  // CAroot: '', // ex. 'AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt'
```

# TX proposal life cycle

Tx proposal need to be:
 1. First created via /v?/txproposal
      -> This will create a 'temporary' TX proposal, returning the object, but not locking the inputs
 2. Then published via  /v?/txproposal/:id/publish
      -> This publish the tx proposal to all copayers, looking the inputs. The TX proposal can be `deleted` also, after been published.
 3. Then signed via /v?/txproposal/:id/signature for each copayer
 4. Then broadcasted to the p2p network via /v?/txproposal/:id/broadcast


# REST API

Note: all currency amounts are in units of satoshis (1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin).

## Authentication

  In order to access a wallet, clients are required to send the headers:
```
  x-identity
  x-signature
```
Identity is the Peer-ID, this will identify the peer and its wallet. Signature is the current request signature, using `requestSigningKey`, the `m/1/1` derivative of the Extended Private Key.

See [Bitcore Wallet Client](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-client/blob/master/lib/api.js#L73) for implementation details.
