**A pure and powerful JavaScript Bitcoin *Cash* library.**

## Principles

Bitcoin Cash is an other powerful peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for highly resilient bitcoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement bitcoin apps and services.

## Bitcoin Cash changes

Bitcoin cash uses a different `sighash` for transaction signatures. The implementation in bitcore-cash has been tested agains the original bitcoin-cash test vectors (see sighash.json in `/test`). `bitcoin-cash` modifications in script evaluation has not been implemented yet.

## Get Started

```sh
npm install bitcore-lib-cash
```

Adding Bitcore Cash to your app's `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "bitcore-lib-cash": "=0.18.0",
    ...
}
```

## Documentation

The complete docs are hosted here: [bitcore documentation](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore). There's also a [bitcore API reference](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/packages/bitcore-node/docs/api-documentation.md) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, where you'll find low-level details on each bitcore utility.

## Building the Browser Bundle

To build a bitcore-lib full bundle for the browser:

```sh
gulp browser
```

This will generate files named `bitcore-lib-cash.js` and `bitcore-lib-cash.min.js`.

You can also use our pre-generated files, provided for each release along with a PGP signature by one of the project's maintainers. To get them, checkout the [releases](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/packages/bitcore-lib-cash/CHANGELOG.md).

## Development & Tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-lib-cash
cd bitcore-lib
npm install
```

Run all the tests:

```sh
gulp test
```

You can also run just the Node.js tests with `gulp test:node`, just the browser tests with `gulp test:browser`
or create a test coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it) with `gulp coverage`.

## Security

We're using Bitcore in production, as are many others, but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.
