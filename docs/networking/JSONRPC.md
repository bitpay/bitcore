# > `bitcore.transport.RPC`

## Description

Bitcoind provides a solid integration with the bitcoin network and it also exposes a `JSON-RPC` API. This class allows to connect to a local instance of a bitcoind server and make simple or batch RPC calls to it.

## Connection to bitcoind

First you will need a running instance of bitcoind, setting up a username and password to connect with it. For more information about running bitcoind please refer to the official documentation.

The code for creating and configuring an instance of the RPC client looks like this:

```
var bitcore = require('bitcore');
var RPC = bitcore.transport.RPC;

var client = new RPC('username', 'password', {
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 18332,
  secure: false,
  disableAgent: true,
  rejectUnauthorized: true
});
```


## Examples

For more information please refer to the [API reference](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29).

```
var bitcore = require('bitcore');
var blockHash = '0000000000000000045d581af7fa3b6110266ece8131424d95bf490af828be1c';

var client = new bitcore.transport.RPC('username', 'password');

client.getBlock(blockHash, function(err, block) {
  // do something with the block
});

```
