[![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bitcore.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bitcore)
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/bitpay/bitcore.svg?branch=master&style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/bitpay/bitcore)

Infrastructure to build Bitcoin and blockchain-based applications for the next generation of financial technology.

**Note:** If you're looking for the Bitcore Library please see: https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-lib

## Prerequisites

- GNU/Linux x86_32/x86_64, or OSX 64bit *(for bitcoind distributed binaries)*
- Node.js v0.10, v0.12 or v4
- ZeroMQ *(libzmq3-dev for Ubuntu/Debian or [zeromq on OSX](http://brewformulas.org/Zeromq))*
- ~200GB of disk storage
- ~8GB of RAM

## Getting Started

Before you begin you'll need to have Node.js v8 installed. There are several options for installation. One method is to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily switch between different versions, or download directly from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
$ npm install -g bitcore
```

Spin up a full node and join the network:

```bash
$ npm install -g bitcore
$ bitcored
```

You can then view the Insight block explorer at the default location: `http://localhost:3001/insight`, and your configuration file will be found in your home directory at `~/.bitcore`.

Create a transaction:
```js
var bitcore = require('bitcore');
var transaction = new bitcore.Transaction();
var transaction.from(unspent).to(address, amount);
transaction.sign(privateKey);
```
